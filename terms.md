## Introduction

These Terms of Service govern Fasten Health's relationship with you as you interact with Fasten Health's services. By using Fasten Health's services, you agree to these terms.
The Services are provided by Fasten Health, Inc. ("Fasten Health"), a Delaware corporation in the United States of America. Your agreement to these terms is between you and Fasten Health, Inc.
When we say Fasten, Fasten Health, "we", "us", or "our", we mean Fasten Health, Inc. and its associates.

## Age

You must be 13 years of age or older to use our services. If you are under 13, you can still have a Fasten Health account and profile, but it must be managed by your legal parent or guardian. If your country of residence is not the USA, then your government may dictate different age restrictions for managing your own online account containing personal health information and by using Fasten Health you certify you meet this age minimum. You agree that you are of legal age or otherwise have legal authority to enter into this binding contract with Fasten Health.

## Change of Experience

Your experience will change over time while using Fasten Health because we constantly develop our services and strive to make continual improvements. We will sometimes add or remove features and/or functionalities as well as increase or decrease limits to our service. You will be notified by email or in the app when we believe a change will substantially affect your usage of Fasten Health.

## Conduct

You agree to follow all applicable laws while using our services and you agree not to abuse or otherwise disrupt our services by interacting with them in a way we did not clearly intend.

## Your Content

By uploading or otherwise importing data into Fasten Health, you agree that you have a legal right to use that data in the ways you choose to while using Fasten Health, including sharing that data with us and with anyone else you choose to share with.
If you upload your own creative or non-public factual data into Fasten Health, this data remains yours. For as long as you maintain an active account and do not delete all of your data, you grant Fasten Health a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use your data for the purpose of operating and improving our services. Fasten Health will not share your personally identifiable data with any 3rd party unless you explicitly tell us to share with them, such as by clicking a share button in the Fasten Health app.

## Fasten Health's Intellectual Property Rights

The services provided by Fasten Health, including the contents of any website or other application, including its appearance, editorial information, notices, software, and other material, are protected under applicable United States and other applicable copyright, trademark, and other laws. Your use of the services provided by Fasten Health are subject to a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use such services. Such services are provided without any transfer of intellectual property rights to you.

## Communication

We communicate with you in order to provide the services including updates about your account and announcements about new functionality. Some emails and other communications are important enough that we will send them to you no matter what as long as you have an active account, such as login and security emails. For optional communication such as weekly summaries and product announcements, we will provide an easy option for you to disable these at any time. We will not make you wait 10 days for your communication preferences to be updated.

## Third Party Data

By connecting your patient portals, fitness apps, or any other third party services to your Fasten Health account, you are authorizing us to obtain and store all health or other information this third party sends to us. Third parties will often allow you to customize which exact data you share when connecting to Fasten Health, but this is not guaranteed and we don't have direct control over which data is sent to us. However, you are in full control and can always delete your data from Fasten Health.
We cannot guarantee the quality, accuracy, legality, completeness, or timeliness of data that comes from third parties, including both the services you connect via login and any documents that you upload to Fasten Health. We will use reasonable effort and skill to improve the quality and display of data when we can, but our efforts will still be imperfect and may occasionally result in inaccuracies. Always consult a qualified medical professional before you take actions regarding your health data, and always double-check with your healthcare provider if your information seems wrong.

## Medical Advice

Fasten Health's services are not intended to provide medical advice. Fasten Health is designed to organize and retrieve information, and we sometimes cite the publicly available recommendations of health authorities, such as recommended daily step counts by the CDC. These should be interpreted as convenient information retrieval from public sources, not as advice from Fasten Health. You should talk to a qualified medical professional before taking actions regarding your health.

## Commitments and Warranty

Our warranty is to provide our services with reasonable skill and care. Beyond this, the only commitments we make to you are those provided by applicable law. We make no further commitments regarding our services, including any implied warranties or fitness for particular purpose.

## Liability

To the extent permitted by law, Fasten Health won't be responsible whether in contract, tort, or otherwise for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, liquidated or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profit, revenue or business, arising in whole or in part from the service or this agreement, even if Fasten Health has been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the extent permitted by law, you'll indemnify Fasten Health and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors from any use by you of our services that violates these terms of service. This indemnity covers all possible liability and expense allowed for by applicable law.

## Disabling your Access

We may temporarily or permanently disable your access to our services if you breach these terms of service. In such a case, we will refund any payment for services you have not yet received, either pro-rated or in full.

## Governing Law

California law will govern all disputes relating to these terms of service to the extent permissible by applicable law. Any action brought relating to these terms or relating to the services provided by Fasten Health must be brought in the state or federal courts of California.

## Privacy

To understand how Fasten Health uses personal information and other data, see our Privacy Policy.

## About these Terms

If any specific term in these terms of service ends up being invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the other terms will not be affected.
We will change these terms of service and our privacy policy over time and when changes occur they will be effective immediately unless explicitly stated otherwise. You will be notified by email or in the app when we believe a major change is relevant to your use of our services. If we ever make fundamental changes like sharing your data to a new class of 3rd parties, your account and data will not be subject to the new changes until you have explicitly consented to the changes within the Fasten Health app.
