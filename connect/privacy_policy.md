## We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information

We don’t sell your personal information, ever. That includes your name, contact details, and any health-related data.

When you use Fasten Connect to link your health information with a third-party app, we only share the specific data you
have agreed to share. This may include diagnostic, treatment, or billing information. That data is temporarily stored on 
secure Fasten Health servers to ensure reliable delivery of our services. This data is automatically deleted within 24 
hours after successful transmission.

If we work with trusted third-party vendors, such as cloud storage or analytics services, it is solely to help deliver 
and improve Fasten Connect. These vendors are not allowed to use your data for their own marketing or advertising.

## Definition of Personal Information

"Personal Information" means any information that can identify you. It includes:

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** This includes any information that can directly identify an individual or is capable of doing so when combined with other information. Examples include but are not limited to an individual's name, address, email address, phone number, or social security number. 
- **Protected Health Information (PHI):** This includes any information in an individual's medical record that can be used to identify an individual and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service such as diagnosis or treatment. It includes, but is not limited to, details such as the individual’s physical or mental health or condition, health care services that the individual receives, or a health plan’s payment for these services, such as the individual’s name, address, telephone number, health insurance information, Medicare Beneficiary number, or financial information related to payment for healthcare services.

We do not currently anonymize or de-identify your Personal Information. If we want to anonymize or de-identify your Personal Information in the future, then we will update this Policy and explain how that will happen.

stated in TEFCA and applicable guidance that may be issued by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.

Third-party service providers must safeguard the Personal Information we entrust to them and are permitted to use such

information for their own direct marketing purposes. 

The handling of shared information is subject to the privacy policies of these third-party providers, including any 
Personal Information accessed through them. These providers are also expected to guide you on how to adjust your privacy 
settings on their platforms.

Here are the ways we may share your information:

- With affiliates that assist us in providing you with our Services, such as payment processors and cloud service providers, but we will require our affiliates to only use or disclose your information for the purposes of providing the services requested of them and in accordance with this Policy.
- If we believe that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities; or (c) protect the safety, rights, or property of Fasten Health, the public, or any person.
- We may share your Personal Information with other businesses in connection with the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of our business to those businesses. We will require those businesses to honor the rules of this Policy.

It is important to note that our third-party service providers have their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to read their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information.

By using Fasten Connect, you agree to the practices described in this section. If you want to opt out of sharing your Personal
Information, then you can notify us and you should stop using our Services. If you have any concerns about how we share your 
information, please contact us at [notices@fastenhealth.com](mailto:notices@fastenhealth.com).

We will not use your Personal Information to assert any form of claim or demand against you, unless you owe us a fee and we need to
use your Personal Information to collect amounts owed to us.

## How We Secure Your Information

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially
acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store in order to protect
it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. One aspect of the security measures we take 
is to encrypt data both at rest and in transit.

However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure,
and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.

In the unlikely event that our systems are breached, we will immediately fix any damage and add more protection to prevent
it from happening again. If your Personal Information is compromised, we will notify you of what was compromised and any
recommended actions you should take.

## How to Access, Update or Delete Your Information

You may contact us to request access, updates or deletions of your Personal Information by contacting us at [notices@fastenhealth.com](mailto:notices@fastenhealth.com).

your Personal Information, we will provide you with an export of your Personal Information if it is still in our possession.

Upon your request, Fasten Health will permanently delete 100% of your personal information, including all associated data 
stored on our systems. This deletion is irreversible and applies to all identifiable data under your account, in accordance 
with applicable laws and data retention obligations.

Fasten Health will take action on an individual's requests no later than 30 calendar days from the receipt of
the request. In cases where, due to unforeseen circumstances, we are unable to meet this timeframe, Fasten Health will provide
the individual, within the initial 30-day period, with a written statement explaining the reasons for the delay and the
anticipated date by which we will complete the requested action.
