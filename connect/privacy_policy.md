# Fasten Connect - Privacy Policy

#### Effective as of {{page.effective}}

This Privacy Policy explains how Fasten Health, Inc. ("Fasten Health," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares 
your personal information when you use Fasten Connect. This includes our website https://www.fastenhealth.com/connect, 
the Fasten Connect API https://api.connect.fastenhealth.com, the Fasten Connect Portal https://portal.connect.fastenhealth.com, 
and any related services (together, "Fasten Connect" or the "Services").

Fasten Health respects your privacy and handles your personal information with care. This Privacy Policy applies only to 
Fasten Connect, not to other products or services we offer.

## We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information

We don’t sell your personal information, ever. That includes your name, contact details, and any health-related data.

When you use Fasten Connect to link your health information with a third-party app, we only share the specific data you
have agreed to share. This may include diagnostic, treatment, or billing information. That data is temporarily stored on 
secure Fasten Health servers to ensure reliable delivery of our services.

If we work with trusted third-party vendors, such as cloud storage or analytics services, it is solely to help deliver 
and improve Fasten Connect. These vendors are not allowed to use your data for their own marketing or advertising.

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** This includes any information that can directly identify an individual or is capable of doing so when combined with other information. Examples include but are not limited to an individual's name, address, email address, phone number, or social security number. 
- **Protected Health Information (PHI):** This includes any information in an individual's medical record that can be used to identify an individual and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service such as diagnosis or treatment. It includes, but is not limited to, details such as the individual’s physical or mental health or condition, health care services that the individual receives, or a health plan’s payment for these services, such as the individual’s name, address, telephone number, health insurance information, Medicare Beneficiary number, or financial information related to payment for healthcare services.

This policy does not cover anonymized or de-identified data that can’t be used to identify you.
