## 7.2 Access Establishment and Modification

1. Requests for access to Luma production systems is made formally using the following process:
   1. A Luma workforce member initiates the access request our issue tracking software via a dedicated queue entitled "Access Requests."
     * User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.
     * Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must be verified over the phone.
     * For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Issue.
   1. The workforce member's direct manager will indicate on the request that it has their approval and is pertinent to the employee's job function.
   1. The Head of Engineering or his/her representative under the auspices of the Security Officer or Privacy Officer will grant access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional access is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a description of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.
   1. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer or a representative approves or rejects the request. If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
   1. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer confirms this on the reques, adding any pertinent notes required. The Security Officer or Privacy Officer or a representative then grants requested access.
     * New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all requirements from [ยง7.12](#712-password-management), which must be changed on the initial login.
     * All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.
     * For non-production systems, access grants are accomplished by leveraging the access control mechanisms built into those systems. Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a Luma employee at the discretion of the Security Officer or Privacy Officer.
1. Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Luma Security Officer or Privacy Officer or a representative;
1. The request for access is retained for future reference.
1. All access to Luma production systems are reviewed and updated on a bi-annual basis to ensure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:
   1. The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Asana Privacy and Security Project under Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Project.
   1. The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Luma workforce member.
   1. If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the process below is used to modify user access and notify the user of access changes. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.
   1. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
   1. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
   1. Review of user access is monitored on a quarterly basis using Asana reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
1. Any Luma workforce member can request change of access using the process outlined in [ยง7.2 paragraph 1](#72-access-establishment-and-modification).
1. Access to production systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication provided by Aptible.
1. Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.
   * Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.
   * Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.
1. In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Luma Customers to define, and not Luma.
1. Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.
   * For production systems, this is enforced by creating non-privileged user accounts that must invoke `sudo` to perform privileged tasks.
   * Rights for privileged accounts are granted by the Security Officer or Privacy Officer using the process outlined in [ยง7.2 paragraph 1](#72-access-establishment-and-modification).
1. All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.
1. Generic accounts are not allowed on Luma systems.
1. Access is granted utilizing two-factor authentication.
    * Two-factor authentication is accomplished using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as the second factor.
    * sessions are automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.
1. In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.
1. Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.
1. Direct access to systems continaing ePHI is not possible as controlled by Aptible. Backend access via SSH to a bastion layer is managed with granular, role-based API permissions and 2-factor authentication with FIDO U2F security key support. Architecure design is found here: [https://www.aptible.com/assets/aptible-enclave-reference-architecture.pdf](https://www.aptible.com/assets/aptible-enclave-reference-architecture.pdf)

## 7.3 Workforce Clearance

1. The level of security assigned to a user of the production platform is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
1. All access requests are treated on a "least-access principle."
1. Luma maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Luma, including all workforce members, does not access any ePHI except out of necessity to address Customer issues. Select set of job roles are cleared to access ePHI specifically customer success, customer support, and engineering.
1. Customers can add additional users to their account for access to the messaging platform. It is the Customer's responsibility to verify appropriate access. Customer will be responsible to remove additional users.

   * Luma's current support desk software, Zendesk, requires users to authenticate before submitting support tickets.
   * Support issues submitted by email must be verified by Luma personnel using an email that has been registered with the corresponding account. This is cross referenced with email listed within Luma's system.
1. Authorized workforce members can impersonate Customer accounts for the purposes of updating settings and addressing Customer issues. This tool requires two-factor authentication and is logged as workforce access.
1. Identity of additional users added by the Customer to access the messaging platform will be verified by the Customer and not responsibility of Luma.

## 7.6 Unique User Identification
