# 16.  Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Luma is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis.

Luma utilizes [GitHub security](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) and our hosting service [Aptible](https://www.aptible.com/documentation/deploy/reference/apps/security-scans.html) to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems along with [intruder](https://intruder.io/) as an external vulnerability scanner.

We also utilize [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) also via our hosting service Aptible on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## 16.2 Vulnerability Scanning Policy

1. GitHub security management is performed by the Luma Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.
1. GitHub is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Luma networks.
1. Frequency of scanning is as follows:
   * on a weekly basis
   * after every production deployment
1. Reviewing GitHub reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the Luma Security Officer or a delegate. The process for reviewing GitHub reports is outlined below:
   1. The Security Officer initiates the review of a GitGHub Report by creating an Issue in the Asana Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Project. If deemed appropriate, the Security Officer may choose to address the issue without creating a ticket with the aid of a delegate.
   1. The Security Officer, or a Luma Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the Nessus Report.
   1. If new vulnerabilities are found during review, the process below is used to test those vulnerabilities is outlined below. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.
   1. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review.
   1. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
1. In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
   * All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
   * Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Luma.
     * Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
     * Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Luma Risk Assessment Policy.
1. All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Luma. Vulnerability report review is monitored on a quarterly basis using Asana reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
1. Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Luma vulnerability management policy by our hosting partner Aptible who conducts them at least annually. [3.H - Enclave Penetration Testing](https://www.aptible.com/legal/security/)
1. This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
