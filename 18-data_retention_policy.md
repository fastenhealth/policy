# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Luma understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Luma is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Luma has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Luma Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)
