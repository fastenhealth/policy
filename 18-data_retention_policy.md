# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Luma understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Luma is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Luma has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Luma Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

## 18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Luma Customers have data stored by Luma as a part of the Luma Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined [System Access Policy ยง7.11](#7.11-system-access-policy), the following steps are taken
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email to confirm the status change and given option to get an extract of data.
  1. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days or as determined appropriate based on Customer response, Luma removes data from Luma systems per internal procedures and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
  1. If Customer requests data extract, the extract is made available for download for 30 days after which the extract is deleted.
* Luma documents and maintains designated record sets that are subject to access by individuals. 
  1.  Records include titles of the persons or office responsible for receiving and processing requests for access
  2.  Relevant record set
  3.  Records are retained indefinitely in Google Drive
